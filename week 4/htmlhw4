    <h1>Why arcade sticks??!</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Danesh Hemchand.  I have many years of experience working with customers, and now I want to expand my knowledge in the area of coding. I reviewed several boot camps and chose Savvy Coders. I had a friend who graduated from a coding school and is doing very well so I thought I would do the same.
 My capstone project is on Arcade Stick hardware. I played a lot on arcade cabinets as a kid and still do now thanks to the new style of gaming establishments called Barcades. When at home I use Arcade Sticks on new systems. I like to share this information with those who don't know this type of hardware exists and for those who want to begin using it. I'm developing the website in  java, html, and css. </p>
